# OneThing VS Code theme

A theme made predominately for personal use by [Matt Tew](https://matt.tew.io), but may also be useful for developers who are distracted or overwhelmed by multiple colours.

Features mostly white-on-black high contrast colours, with an accent for keywords, symbols and highights.
